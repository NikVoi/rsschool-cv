***Brief information about myself:*** 

At the moment, I have set myself the goal of learning how to work with the React Framework. And make several projects on it. I studied layout independently, I thought when I entered the university I would have more opportunities to learn different information about front-end development. It turned out that they don't teach anything much.

I can't single out any of the strengths yet, because I don't work so much in this field of programming. Well, although there is experience in solving algorithmic problems, but js has its own interesting chips for solving a particular problem, which in turn require study.

There are different initial projects on the branch in the git profile for getting practice.

***Code example:***

```
function openOrSenior(data){
    let array = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++){
        for (let j = 0; j < data[i].length; j++){
          if (data[i][0] >= 55 && data[i][1] > 7){
              array.push("Senior");
              break;
          }else{
              array.push("Open");
              break;
          }
        }
    }
    return array;
}
```
